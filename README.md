# MAThesis

This repostitory contains an exemplary implementation of the workflow presented in the master thesis. The notebook is designed for Colab, but can be adapted for any other environment. To do this, the repository must be loaded into the drive (using a notebook or via download and upload). Afterwards the description of the usage is inside the notebook.
